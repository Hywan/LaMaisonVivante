# Blinds

In our house, blinds are directly plugged in a
[Controllino](https://www.controllino.biz/). It means that physical
buttons are inputs of the Controllino.

The `blinds.ino` Arduino program lands in the Controllino. It sets a
simple automata to control the motor of the blinds. The code is
largely documented, so enjoy!
